                <h1>Usually, people talk about a mother’slove and affection, in which a father’s love often gets ignored. A mother’s love is talked about repeatedly everywhere, in movies, in shows and more. Yet, what we fail to acknowledge is the strength of a father which often goes unnoticed. Father’s a blessing which not many people have in their lives. It would also be wrong to say that every father is the ideal hero for their kids because that is not the case. However, I can vouch for my father without any second thoughts when it comes to being an ideal person. <br>

              As everyone likes to believe that their father is different, so do I. Nonetheless, this conviction is not merely based on the love I have for him, but also because of his personality. My father owns a business and is quite disciplined in all aspects of life. He is the one who taught me to always practice discipline no matter what work I do.
                
                Most importantly, he has a jovial nature and always makes my mother laugh with his silly antics even after 27 years of marriage. I completely adore this silly side of him when he is with his loved ones. He tries his best to fulfill all our wishes but also maintains the strictness when the need arises.
                I can proudly say that it is my father who has been my source of inspiration from day one. In other words, his perspective and personality together have shaped me as a person. Similarly, he has a great impact on the world as well in his own little ways. He devotes his free time in taking care of stray animals which inspires me to do the same.

                    <h1>
                        My dad has been there for me every step of the way. From teaching me the essentials like walking and talking to just the simple joys in life like riding a bike and driving a car. Every step of the way he was right there telling me how proud he was. To some those are just simple words but to me they mean so much more. The one thing I want in life is to make my parents proud and to never disappoint them. But what my dad doesn’t know is how proud I am of him. I’m proud of how he puts family first, always. I can always count on my Dad to be there at everything I do. I’m proud of his sense of humor, and how he lifts the spirits of those around him; how he can lift the spirits of our family when times are tough. My dad did not have the easiest childhood, he lost his mother as a teenager and grew up with just a father but still today he is one of the happiest most joyful hearted men I know and for that I am proud.

                        One of the best things I love about my father is that he has always kept a very safe and open home environment. For instance, my siblings and I can talk about anything with him without the fear of being scolded or judged. This has helped us not to lie, which I have often noticed with my friends.

In addition, my father has an undying love for animals which makes him very sympathetic towards them. He practices his religion devotedly and is very charitable too. I have never seen my father misbehave with his elders in my entire life which makes me want to be like him even more.
